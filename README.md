# Lumosity-Game
Lumosity is an android game which is played by two persons. Players move the balls (mills) across available spaces in board and try to create a row or column of their 3 balls. Once it is achieved the user can remove the opponent ball. If the player has three balls only, he/she can move the ball to any point on the board.
